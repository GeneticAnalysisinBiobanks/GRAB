Description: Provides a comprehensive suite of genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods 
    specifically designed for biobank-scale data, including but not limited to, robust approaches 
    for time-to-event traits (Li et al., 2025 <doi:10.1038/s43588-025-00864-z>) and ordinal 
    categorical traits (Bi et al., 2021 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.03.019>). The package also offers 
    general frameworks for GWAS of any trait type (Bi et al., 2020 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.06.003>), 
    while accounting for sample relatedness (Xu et al., 2025 <doi:10.1038/s41467-025-56669-1>) or 
    population structure (Ma et al., 2025 <doi:10.1186/s13059-025-03827-9>). By accurately 
    approximating score statistic distributions using saddlepoint approximation (SPA), these 
    methods can effectively control type I error rates for rare variants and in the presence of 
    unbalanced phenotype distributions. Additionally, the package includes functions for simulating 
    genotype and phenotype data to support research and method development.
